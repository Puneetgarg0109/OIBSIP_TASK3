# OIBSIP_TASK3
This is github repo of Task 3 of Oasis Infobyte Internship

 This IS a TODO app
in which we have  a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.
I can also add a separate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion. In such a case, the to-do list will be a union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list
